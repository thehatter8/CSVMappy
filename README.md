# CSVMappy
Takes 2 column CSV from my other project (or any with the right setup) and makes a map using QGIS using python libraries,



# Notes:

I will be updating this REPO with instructions and such eventually. I crashed the morning after making this and slept from 12noon to 7AM the next day (typing this at 8AM) so I am dead tired.

This is the first finished product based on my personal data! Yours will look a lot different depending on where you live and if you travel. I also deleted my GMaps data in 2020 so I am missing a TON of locations. If I expand this to google photos data as well, you will see pictures from all over the world!

# Old images

Here are some old images I rendered before I got to the final product! It sure was a learning curve doing this for the first time!
The hardest part was coloring just the counties. I could not find good documentation for it and Stackoverflow was killing my brain at 5AM! I knocked this project out in a single night because "I'll sleep when I finish X. Oh, X was easy. Maybe I'll sleep when I finish Y. Oh, Y....."
