# CSVMappy
Takes 2 column CSV from my other project (or any with the right setup) and makes a map using QGIS using python libraries,



# Notes:

I will be updating this REPO with instructions and such eventually. I crashed the morning after making this and slept from 12noon to 7AM the next day (typing this at 8AM) so I am dead tired.
